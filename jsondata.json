It would be nice to have the proximity data to compare to but its not available on the OSM. There are two scenarios that Im thinking of here\\r\\n1. Sensor issue:  could be issue with the mounting block stiffness/tightness or electrical interference on the cabling.\\r\\n   a. Given the location of these two sensors the reading should be closer to each other the way it is now, not how it was back in May.  With the large variance between BB1/BB2 and the lack of proximity data it is difficult to come to any conclusions.  \\r\\n2. Potential mass shift/loss:  \\r\\n   a. The increase in amplitudes over time and the change in transient vibrations could suggest either a HGP component erosion or compressor blade migration.\\r\\n   b. Without high confidence in the sensors I wouldnt jump to any conclusions so the most urgent disposition on this would be to borescope at the next outage once a sensor issue is eliminated. \\r\\n\\r\\nA balance shot could potentially lower the amplitudes but wouldnt solve the problem.  \",\"notes\":\"\",\"likelihood\":\"LIKELY\",\"blueprintName\":\"CT_GE7FA_S\",\"caseStatus\":{\"status\":\"UNDERCUSTOMERREVIEW\"},\"assetId\":\"3324\",\"name\":\"TAS1 GT1 - CT Journal Bearing #1 - Local Bearing Problem\",\"diagnosis\":\"Vibrations are starting to increase as high as 0.52in/sec.

At this moment the gas turbine is being fed with natural gas and that is why temperature is lower (gas compressor is being serviced). Oscillations might have been caused by work being done on the instruments, PLCs and communication links.Regarding 26th  29th period (shut down began on the 29th), lower 16T409 & 16F200 = 0 (refinery fuel gas compressed by C-1631s), means gas compressor is shut down and natural gas is being supplied to the gas turbine as only fuel.

BP Castellon to also provide tags for different operation (valve for natural gas) and efficiency if available. The IPRC to continue to monitor the item and keep the item on the report.  9/24:As we discussed in the last call, I send you this mail, trying explain the process, and why the gas temperature sometimes is more higher and how detect that this values is a normal running of the turbine.The different temperatures from the gas supply to the turbine is normal, and depends that the mixture of gases to introduce to the turbine, Natural gas, or/and refinery gas from the Compressor, depends of the amount of different gas, the temperature of gas to the turbine may be different.The temperature of gas from the compressor we can see with the 16T411T signal transmitter, and the amount of FG flow injected to the turbine with 16F451C.The amount of Natural gas injected to the turbine, we can see through of 16F450. When we are mixing the gas (NG and FG), we heat the natural gas, for avoid condensations (dev point + 20C) in the FG, and the result of the temperature mixture we can measurement with 16T212.Please see in the below graphic different amounts of gases mixtures with different gas mixture temperatures to the turbine (16T212).This is a normal running of the turbine. If only we supply NG to the turbine, we do not heat the gas because the dev point of this gas is very low.For example in the last 7 days, we are running the turbine with Natural Gas only, and the gas supply temperature is like that ambient temperature:Regarding the increase temperature of the liquid manifold, is because the gas manifold and liquid manifold inside of package turbine is very near (a few centimeters), and per temperature radiation this measurement is little bit higher.Please find attached the P&Id of the circuit.SV50025b:SV50026F:SV50140SN:\",\"equipmentType\":\"COMBUSTION_TURBINE\"}","updateTime":1484729601650},{"uuid":"3156","caseId":19530,"data":"{\"symptoms\":\"Increase in virbations starting on 9/7 and continued on 9/8.\",\"notes\":\"\\n16V7513\",\"likelihood\":\"SOMEWHATLIKELY\",\"blueprintName\":\"CT_1RGG_1PT_S\",\"caseStatus\":{\"status\":\"CLOSEDNOTACTIONED\"},\"assetId\":\"3152\",\"name\":\"increase in bearing vibrations\",\"diagnosis\":\"\",\"recommendation\":\"\",\"updatedOn\":1473463270163,\"responseMessage\":\"\",\"equipmentType\":\"COMBUSTION_TURBINE\"}","updateTime":1484729601650},{"uuid":"10414","caseId":10566,"data":"{\"symptoms\":\"On 10/7, Vibration Sensor - Turb on Bearing 1 spiked to 0.319in/sec, 0.1in/sec higher than the model predicted.

It appears the valve was assembled incorrectly in that 2 of the 3 required gaskets were not present.  The lower seat gasket may have initially been installed and washed out over time.

This eventually created enough space for the cage to lift and allow the seat ring to move downstream out of position  blocking part of the flow.  The valve was reassembled based on the available drawings and appears to be working properly.

We need to confirm mapping  based on tag names the mapping is correct  based on data it appears CTG BRG 1 Temp 1 and CTG BRG 2 Temp 1 are the tags for one bearing while the other 2 TC are the tags for the other bearing.   2.  There may be a bearing issue with the 2 TCs that are ~226 and the other is ~238.  3. If condition is real  the unit alignment may need to be checked as one pad on each bearing is taking the load.  MND Case 20160629-2587 Possible Cause: This case was escalated by the M&D Center for elevated bearing metal temperatures on the Generator Collector end bearing. One of the sensors  BTGJ2_2  exceeded the M&D Early Warning limit of 250F  reaching upwards of 254F for more than 3 hr. The rest of the metal temperatures all remain below the warning limits. Lube oil temperature had remained fairly constant between 130F - 135F. M&D and customer should both continue to carefully monitor BMT. At temperatures above 260F  GE recommends the site make plans to shutdown to inspect the bearing (with spare bearing available). Temperatures over 260F can result in babbitt creep or metallurgical changes to the babbitt. The temperature range of 260-265F is the standard industry high temperature limit for long term bearing operation. It is generally permissible for the unit to keep running up to 270F in preparation for the shutdown  but under no circumstances should BMT exceed 275F. At BMT of 275F GE recommends immediate shutdown.  Since the startup on 6/10/2016 there has been a slow increase in bearing metal temperatures for both generator bearings. The GT bearing metal temperature have remained relatively level so it does not appear that there is an alignment shift driving creating a change in bearing load. If you trend the highest metal temperature reading from BTGJ2_2 the unit would exceed the 265F limit around the end of July to beginning of August 2016  assuming operation rhythm remains similar (plot with straight fit line attached). Please plan to shutdown for inspection if metal temperature exceed 265F. PAC Case Desired Deliverable: Recommendations to correct bearing metal temperature on TE Generator Bearing. Also I have heard from another CSL that some sites have changed the Generator TE bearing from an elliptical bearing to a tilt pad bearing to address these high bearing metal temps. Does GE have records of this bearing change at some sites And if so is that an option for the Nelson unit\",\"recommendation\":\"\",\"updatedOn\":1473462914754,\"responseMessage\":\"Weekly Call 5/17/16: Site will investigate  will check what the temperatures are reading for the bearings. Weekly Call 6/21/16: Site has been having warmer days  GE has seen it where temps reach ~250degF  and then a temperature drop that shows that the babbit has moved. Lube Oil alarm is at ~150degF  100degree difference between bearing metal temp and lube oil temp  potential issues with the babbit could arise. Max cooling for the lube oil currently. Weekly Call 6/27/16: The drain temp won't move until the bearing moves   not expecting the oil drain temps to move  this bearing is an elliptical bearing  there is an orifice for this bearing  it is a function of the oil wedge. Oil sampled and showed no particles. There could a very small dimple in the oil  and this can cause a false reading for the bearing temp. Manny will perform an analysis and look for TIL in reference to dimpling. Weekly Call 7/5/16: Operation Staff verified RTD Calibration and output  looks good. Conducted lift test on shaft  lift looks good showing movement. We will go in and look for lift oil leak when available. Temps were flat for the second half of 2015  and has seen the differences between the two bearing metal temps was seen during this time as well  since the beginning of 2016  temperature has been slowly increasing  and then in June temperature started to increase more rapidly. Site previously had issues with a twisted alignment and the bearing liner  site believes this could be the same issue. Site has created a PAC case for this issue. Weekly Call 7/12/16: Site is continuing to monitor  and if the temperature continues to increase  site will schedule an outage. If temperature hits 260   send a notification. AVH will be set to 260. Eric Brown created a PAC case for this  and it had suggestions to resolve this issue. Some of the suggestions are lower lube oil supply temperature  adjust set lift speed to 50%  and this bearing will be included in October outage  the temperature is continuing to increase. Lowering lube oil temp could run into the issue if there is a blockage  this could not work  and could interfere with oil wedge. No issues with brushes. Site is starting up now  and if temperature continues to increase  continue to investigate. Lube Oil was set to 120degF. Weekly Report 7/19/16: Site saw a 15degF drop in the metal temp following the 10degF drop in lube oil  but still seeing that upward trend  lowering the lube oil temp bought time  still seeing it increase at the same rate  and the bearing will still need to inspected. Plan is to inspect the bearing in October if not sooner. Weekly Call 7/26/2016: Site spoke to other plants and Kendall Energy (sister plant  same design) and St. Claire (same equipment  different layout) running synthetic oil  suggested running with higher vacuum in sump.  Pulled 8 in.Hg vacuum on sump (top of recommended vacuum range)  and seems to be helping. St. Claire is running higher vacuum than 8 in.Hg and Kendall is running even higher. Suggested that site checks orifice on opposite side of drains. When in normal outage  drop orifice and measure with micrometer to verify correct orifice for plant design. Site will most likely inspect bearing in upcoming outage in October. Weekly Call 8/9/16: Site is working with Eric and others on this issue  temps are stabilizing  also going to correct the unit 1 generator bearing readings during the next outage as well. Site is running daily reports on this issue. Weekly Call 8/23/16: Temperatures have stabilized for now, and the bearing will most likely not be addressed during the upcoming outage.

I also spoke to engineering in Atlanta and the min max also acts a clamp which will prevent less than a 2% error if it hit the max or min.  This is well within their surge margin (not my words engineering) therefore this sensor is not deemed critical and that is why they only provide 1 so it can fail and not cause a significant change.  Based on this we will categorize the case as a calibration of the sensor as a non-critical device which will carry a very low cost avoidance rating and close it out unless you would like any further action.

At FSNL there does not appear to be a combustion issue indicating that PM1 nozzle are okay. At 30MW (temperature matching) again there does not appear to be a combustion issue indicating that PM1 and PM2 nozzles are okay. The CycleWatch Start-up data shows that the combustion is tracking as expected up to mode 6 when the model turns off. In shield TC12, 13, 14 have shown a slow decrease from the estimate over the last month indicating a possible issue with a particular combustion can. In addition to that TC24 and TC 22 are the lowest TCs depending on the load indicating that there is also an issue with a 2nd combustion can. Verify with OEM but there appears to be an issue with Can #4 and Can #9. The issue on Can #9 has been around and is minor in comparison to the issue on Can #4. Although the swirl indicates Can #4 it could also be Can #3 or #5 as it is often recommended to look at a quadrant. DLN Tuning can be performed to see if that will allow for a temporary fix as the issue maybe a result of combustion hardware degradation or contamination. Contamination could come from the gas fuel system so verify that gas strainers are clean and not damaged, verify that hydrocarbons are not carrying over from the gas yard knock out system.

We will test the LVDT at the Training Center at the earliest possible to confirm the failure.

Did we also replace the cable No, we replaced the LVDT only.\\r\\n2.       What was the real issue behind the LVDT failure Before unit trip we received LVDT out of limit diagnostic alarm for the same LVDT in subject. \\r\\n3.       Was there any physical damage on the LVDT Nothing observed \\r\\n4.       Was it loose No\\r\\n5.       How come the IGV were still reading 73 degrees when they were actually at fully closed position When the unit tripped and the actual position was at fully close position, we were reading 69 degrees.\\r\\n6.       Can we please collect the removed LVDT for our inspection Faulty LVDT handed over to GE. Missing rod.\\r\\nToby Johnson 08/09/16 03:33 PM\\r\\nLooking at the logs it appears that the following occurred:\\r\\n1.       A single LVDT failed high (a very rare failure mode, critical this is understood as even if no damage the only other event of this nature I am aware of did clash the compressor)\\r\\n2.       The controls pick the higher of the two LVDT ( because 99 % of IGV failures are low)\\r\\n3.       The control loop tried to avert this by setting servo current high to close the IGVwhich they did as evidence by airflow , exhaust temp etc\\r\\n4.       The compressor surge (one small and one large) caused because the IGVs were closed and we were still fueling the unit as much as exhaust temp would allow so CPR was high\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compressor bleeds, or at least one of them stuck here but that is not related to the event ( so yes a problem but a small oneunit was already surged and tripped). This event was caused by high LVDT failure. \\r\\n\\r\\n- Will McEntaggart\\r\\nToby Johnson 08/03/16 10:11 AM\\r\\nThe visual inspection was done till 4th stage and the borescope inspection was done at the bottom half till the 6th or 7th stage. We did not find any abnormality. \\r\\nWe asked the customer to make sure that they perform a site walk down during ratcheting and cranking to hear if any abnormal sound is there. \\r\\nIt appears that the faulty LVDT caused the loss of IGV control which triggered the first surge event that was shown via the first vibration spike. \\r\\nThe second spike in the vibration levels looks to be attributed to the failure of bleed valves to open at the trip instance.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegards\\r\\nKarim\\r\\nToby Johnson 08/03/16 10:11 AM\\r\\nLVDT feedback suddenly went up when the command was steady.\\r\\nAs a reaction, the IGV command reduced (driven by the TTRXGV reduction) which caused the over-temperature trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attached trend (298514 High Speed Data Trends) is captured at 40 msec sampling time and shows that the LVDT feedback drove this whole behavior. \\r\\nWe asked the customer to troubleshoot the LVDT failure once the machine is cooled down and replace them if deemed necessary. The IGVs will be calibrated prior to startup.\\r\\nOn a side note, the IGVs are confirmed to be currently closed, however the feedback is stuck at ~78degrees.\",\"equipmentType\":\"COMBUSTION_TURBINE\"}","updateTime":1484729601650},{"uuid":"9601","caseId":14963,"data":"{\"symptoms\":\"Starting on 20-May-2014, bearing 4 vibrations have been increasing up to as high as 0.086 in/s on 23-May-2014.\",\"notes\":\"\\nG1:BB9\",\"likelihood\":\"SOMEWHATLIKELY\",\"blueprintName\":\"CT_GE7FA_S\",\"caseStatus\":{\"status\":\"CLOSEDACTIONED\"},\"assetId\":\"9579\",\"name\":\"Priority 5 Bearing 4 Local Bearing Problem\",\"diagnosis\":\"Were any excitation brushes recently replaced If not, verify that brushes are installed correctly and not too short and there is no arcing going on while online.

Please continue monitoring with this value, and if this value increasing please let us know.IPRC to leave on the report and continue to monitor. April 19: Yes we saw this issue with the restart of the turbine. This is only an indication, I saw the mechanical position of the valve, and is running correctly, the problem is the BV2 indication that is wrong.

Based on email communication between Wansley Plant Engineer and GE M&D Tier I engineer there is a plan in action to address this issue. Site is aware that there are sensor issues on BB4, BB5 & BR1Y. The next course of action would be to replace the seismic sensors to ensure they will not cause a trip on the unit while the balance shot is sorted out. It does not appear that there was any damage that occurred during the High Vibration trip but that it was only triggered by a faulty BB4 and BB1/2 already in alarm condition.

Because this hot spot is seen on multiple adjacent TCs and is seen at various loads, I suspect this to be a real combustion issue. Hot spots during gas fuel operation are typically caused by damaged or burned FN tips allowing excess fuel to port into a combustor OR internal EC damage due to leaks/cracks on EC braze welds but can't be verified via BI and must be confirmed in shop via flow test.                              I recommend site first schedule time during next convenient shutdown to borescope CAN 11 & 12 to ensure there are no burned FN tips or fuses resulting from a flashback as this failure mode is the more concerning of the two. FN damage can cause high NOx but can also result in additional damage to combustion hardware and FNs. Internal EC damage is less concerning as it will cause higher NOx levels but will not risk any additional hardware damage.

No erratic behavior, lagging, or other sensor issue indications. Lack of a combustion cold spot at other loads indicates no combustion hardware issue.At certain loads, TC 9 just happens to fall in the airstream coming from between cans 1 & 2. The exhaust from the perimeter of the cans is cooler than from the center, hence TC 9 is reading cooler temperatures at particular loads. Looking at the last months of data >205 MW, there is an apparent TC 9 shifted colder on 9/27 ~22:00 site local time. However, this corresponds to a change in load, which changes swirl. Hence, the shift in TC 9 is due to a change in the swirl angle When load changed from ~217 MW to ~207 MW, the swirl angle changed and TC9 began reading temperatures from the relatively cooler perimeter of can 2. Hence the cold shift on TC9. Note TC8 shifted warmer at the same time, because it began to read temperature closer to the center of can 1 Also note the cold spot on TC 9 is most prominent at 196 MW, when it reads the temperature from directly between cans 2/1 TC 9 is currently reading about 40 degF colder than TTXM when the unit is running ~200-215 MW.

The first was from full load and attempted restarts were unsuccessful until adjustments to gas pressure setpoints were made. Suspended MBC operation due to its sensitivity related to the burner pluggage. The lean blow out on Sunday occurred when we were recovering from a Wobbe Index triggered runback event. Again  burner pluggage is the likely cause. Restart was successful. This morning we tripped just as unit was reaching full load due to a P2 pressure fluctuation related to the burner pluggage.

TCs 2,23 were unusually hot (~30 deg F above TTXM) then also shifted back to rejoin TTXM during operation. I have no explanation for these shifts other than site possibly replaced while the unit was running (very dangerous, unlikely) or somebody at site jumpered these TCs to others on the terminal board in an attempt to reduce the high spreads. Also, TCs 9 & 24 are constantly ~20 deg F below TTXM which looks slightly unusual. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnalysis:\\r\\nI don't suspect combustion hardware issues at this time as none of these trending TCs are adjacent and there is roughly a 2:1 TC to Can ratio. No issues noted in combustion dynamics, however, data quality is suspect as amplitudes in multiple frequency bins is abnormally low (blowout, low, medium). This is most likely a TC sensor issue or exhaust leak issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf site could provide any emissions information such as issues controlling NOx or CO would give us further insight as to whether or not this is a real combustion issue or sensor/exhaust leak issue. \\r\\n\\r\\nRecommendation:\\r\\nI would recommend site begin by inspecting installation and health of TCs 6,10,12,9,24 (ensure TCs are not touching any metal, inserted to correct depth, oriented in correct direction, etc). If no issues are noted then visually inspect the exhaust directly upstream of these TCs for cracks or separations in exhaust flex seals, diffuser, or excessive gap in the horizontal joint that could potentially allow cooler exhaust frame blower air to leak into the HGP.\\r\\n\",\"recommendation\":\"Continue to monitor.  \",\"updatedOn\":1473463001643,\"responseMessage\":\"The site is planning on replacing the TC's on the next shutdown.
